### Infrastructure As Code

I’m a big believer in DevSecOps and integrating security seamlessly into the software development lifecycle. Secure infrastructure should be automated, repeatable, and scalable, which is why I’m a huge advocate for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). By treating infrastructure like software, we can enforce security best practices from the start—whether it's hardened configurations, automated compliance checks, or secure CI/CD pipelines. This repo is a collection of AWS projects where I explore security automation, cloud best practices, and ways to build resilient, secure systems by design.

I manage my personal AWS account like I would in an enterprise environment. For examples of IAM roles, permissions, and other IaC configurations, checkout the following path in this repo:

```
./Account_Management/_infra
